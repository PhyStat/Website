It was founded in 2000 by Louis Lyons. A wide range of topics is covered: frequentist and Bayesian inference, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, Goodness of Fit testing, confidence interval estimation, unfolding, machine learning, systematic uncertainties, data combination and more. The workshops provide a unique meeting point of Physicists and Statisticians, where the latest advances in statistical techniques and procedures are exchanged. Most of the Workshops have recommended reading material, plus links to material to give Statisticians the necessary background in Particle Physics. The workshops\u2019 timetables have ample time assigned for discussions. The recordings of the workshops provide a comprehensive reference on statistical issues and state of the art methods used in particle physics and neighbouring fields. Olaf Behnke and Lydia Brenner are the current co-chairpersons of PHYSTAT. In 2019, the PHYSTAT Seminar series were initiated by Olaf, which take place about once per month.

Participants will treat each other with respect and consideration to create a collegial, inclusive, and professional environment. Creating a supportive environment to enable scientific discourse is the responsibility of all participants. Participants will avoid any inappropriate actions or statements based on individual characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, ability status, educational background, or any other characteristic protected by law. Disruptive or harassing behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. Harassment includes but is not limited to inappropriate or intimidating behavior and language, unwelcome jokes or comments, offensive images, and stalking. Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported to the meeting organizers. Sanctions may range from verbal warning, to ejection from the meeting, to notifying appropriate authorities. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated. If a participant observes inappropriate comments or actions and personal intervention seems appropriate and safe, they should be considerate of all parties before intervening.
