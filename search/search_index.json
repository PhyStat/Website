It was founded in 2000 by Louis Lyons. A wide range of topics is covered: frequentist and Bayesian inference, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, Goodness of Fit testing, confidence interval estimation, unfolding, multivariate analysis techniques, systematic uncertainties, data combination and more. The workshops provide a unique meeting point of Physicists and Statisticians, where the latest advances in statistical techniques and procedures are exchanged. Most of the Workshops have recommended reading material, plus links to material to give Statisticians the necessary background in Particle Physics. The workshops\u2019 timetables have ample time assigned for discussions. The recordings of the workshops provide a comprehensive reference on statistical issues and state of the art methods used in particle physics and neighbouring fields. Since the beginning of 2018, Olaf Behnke (DESY) is the chairperson of PHYSTAT. In 2019, he initiated the PHYSTAT Seminar series, which take place about once per month.
