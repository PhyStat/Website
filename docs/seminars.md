# PHYSTAT Seminars

## **NEW**: PHYSTAT INFORMAL REVIEWS:

In this new format a Tandem consisting of a physicist and a statistician will review a statistical method introduced by one of the parties or a general critical analysis topic from the Physicist's and Statistician's perspectives. The virtual events comprise: two 20+10 min. complementary presentations followed by ~30 minutes of general discussion.
